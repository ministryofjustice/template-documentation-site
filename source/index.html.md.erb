## Legacy Tech Docs Template Documentation

The Government Digital Service previously published documentation for [`alphagov/tdt-documentation`](https://github.com/alphagov/tdt-documentation), but closed down the site when [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) was decommissioned.

This documentation has been preserved under [`legacy-tdt-documentation`](legacy-tdt-documentation) from the [commit](https://github.com/alphagov/tdt-documentation/commit/53c1d22110ebe6c5123d45c4fd68b833db6cae8c) when it was decommissioned. Changes have been made to fix links specifically in `partials/_links.erb` and any pages that use images.
