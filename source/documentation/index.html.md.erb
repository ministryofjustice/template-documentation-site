# Hello, World!

## Edit Me!

Open `source/documentation/index.html.md.erb` in your favourite text editor and start editing!

You can write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using **all** of the _usual_ syntax that you're used to!

This means you can use things like tables:

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

Food | Kind | Tasty?
--- | --- | ---
Bananas | Fruit | Yes
Aubergines | VegetableÂ | No
Apricots | Fruit | Yes

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

If you want slightly more control, you can always use <strong>HTML</strong>.

For more detail and troubleshooting, take a look at the [README] file in the root of this project.
