# Preview your documentation

You can start a local web server to preview your documentation site.

1. Go to your project folder and run the following in the command line:

    ```shell
    bundle exec middleman server
    ```

    This will create HTML documentation files in the `source/build` folder, then start a local web server.

2. Go to the local web server at `http://localhost:4567/` to preview your documentation.

Press `Ctrl-C` in the command line to stop the web server.

You can also [build your documentation][build-your-docs] to create HTML files without starting a local web server.
