# Build your documentation

1. Open the command line interface and go to your documents folder.

2. Run the following in the command line:

    ```shell
    bundle exec middleman build
    ```

This will create HTML documentation files in the `source/build` folder.

<%= partial "legacy-tdt-documentation/partials/links" %>
