# Maintain your documentation project

This section is about the Tech Docs Template features that help you with the long-term maintenance of your documentation project.

For example, the Tech Docs Template helps you:

- [keep the template up to date][use-latest-template]
- organise a review process with the help of a [Slack bot that monitors your documentation][review-content]
- [set up redirects][redirects] for pages where the URL has changed
