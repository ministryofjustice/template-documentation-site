# Set up redirects

If you do something that changes the URL of a page in your documentation, you should set up a redirect to the new URL.

Redirecting means that users who reach your old URL from other sites will be sent to your new URL instead.

For example, if you restructure the page hierarchy in your documentation, URLs will change, and you should set up redirects.

The Tech Docs Template allows you to set up redirects in either:

- the [global configuration file][global-config]
- the [frontmatter of the page][frontmatter] whose URL changed
- your [`config.rb` file][redirect-configrb]

<%= partial "legacy-tdt-documentation/partials/links" %>
