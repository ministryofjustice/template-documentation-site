# Set up regular content reviews

Make it easier to keep documentation up to date by configuring the page expiry notifier, Daniel the Manual Spaniel.

## How it works

[Daniel the Manual Spaniel][daniel-github] checks for pages that are due for review. It looks at the `review_by` dates in your `/api/pages.json` file, which is generated when you build your documentation.

The Tech Docs Template calculates `review_by` from the [page expiry parameters][review-in] you set in the page frontmatter.

When `review_by` is in the past, the page is due for review, and Daniel the Manual Spaniel sends a Slack notification to the page owner:

<%= image_tag "daniel-the-manual-spaniel-screenshot.svg",
{ :alt => "Screenshot of a Slack notification from Daniel the Manual Spaniel. The user has a spaniel cartoon profile picture. The message says hello followed by a paw prints emoji, and then announces: this is your friendly manual spaniel. I've found a page that is due for review: Support (today)" } %>

The page owner can be a Slack group or a Slack user. You can configure owners for:

- the [whole documentation site][global-config] by editing the `config/tech-docs.yml` file
- [individual pages][frontmatter] by editing the page frontmatter

When defining the owners, frontmatter configuration overrides global configuration.

Daniel the Manual Spaniel will continue notifying the page owner every weekday until `review_by` is in the future.

## Requirements

For Daniel the Manual Spaniel to be able to scan your documentation you must set:

* page expiry parameters in the frontmatter
* owners for your documentation

## Set up the page expiry notifier

There's guidance on [setting up Daniel the Manual Spaniel to scan your documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-monitor) in the alphagov/tech-docs-monitor GitHub repo.
