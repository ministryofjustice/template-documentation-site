# Deploy and host your documentation site

The Tech Docs Template is built on Middleman, which is a static
site generator. You can therefore deploy your site anywhere that supports
static sites.

## GitHub Pages

With some modification, you can also deploy your site with [GitHub Pages][gh-pages], but we do not support this. To do this, you could for example use the [`middleman-gh-pages` tool][middleman-gh-pages], which we do not support.

We also cannot guarantee that all features of the template will work if you deploy your site with GitHub Pages.

The [Ministry of Justice cloud platform documentation][gh-pages-example] uses GitHub Pages.

## Add basic authentication

There are many ways to add basic authentication to your documentation site.

The following instructions apply if you want to deploy your documentation site on any platform using the [Cloud Foundry open source cloud application platform][cf].

This method relies on adding a `Staticfile.auth` file to the `build` folder because building the documentation doesn't automatically add the `Staticfile.auth` file. If you added `Staticfile.auth` once and run the build command again, the file will disappear. You need to add `Staticfile.auth` again to enable basic authentication for the new build.

1. In the command line, navigate to your local documentation repo.

1. If required, run `bundle exec middleman build` to create a `build` folder.

1. Create a new `Staticfile.auth` file in the `build` folder.

1. Go to the [Htpasswd Generator].

1. Complete the __Username__ and __Password__ fields, and select __Create .htpasswd file__.

1. Copy the generated username and password hash into the `Staticfile.auth` file and save.

1. Deploy your documentation site in line with your normal process.
