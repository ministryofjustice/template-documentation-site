# Accessibility

The GOV.UK Technical Documentation Template and its documentation are maintained by the technical writing team at the Government Digital Service (GDS).

## Accessibility statement for the Technical Documentation Template documentation website

This website is run by GDS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

## Using the Technical Documentation Template for your own documentation

This [Technical Documentation Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) was last tested in April 2021. The test was carried out by the [Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/).

While GDS takes steps to ensure the Technical Documentation Template is as accessible as possible by default, you’ll still need to make sure your documentation as a whole meets accessibility requirements. You must research your documentation content to ensure that it’s in context.
