# Configure page settings

You configure individual pages in your documentation by editing the page frontmatter.

The page frontmatter contains page-specific variables at the top of the page.

For a general introduction on frontmatter, see the [Middleman frontmatter documentation][mm].

For example:

```html
---
title: Page title
weight: 100
last_reviewed_on: 2100-01-01
review_in: 1 year
---

If you are not sure which settings to enable or disable, [contact the GDS tech writers][contact-email].

## Required frontmatter settings

There are no required frontmatter settings in a single page documentation site.

In a multipage documentation site, you must include the weight frontmatter setting.

### weight

Sets the order of pages in the left hand navigation.

This setting works the same way as page numbers in a book. A lower weight value is higher in the navigation. A higher weight value is lower in the navigation.

For example a page with a weight of 10 will appear higher in the navigation than a page with a weight of 20.

```yaml
---
weight: 20
---
```

## Optional frontmatter settings

You can enable and disable the following optional settings in the page frontmatter.

### description

Sets the description for the page, which will be used in search engine results or on social media.

```yaml
---
description: Configuring page settings in the GDS Technical Documentation Template.
---
```

### hide_in_navigation

Set `hide_in_navigation: true` to prevent the page from being rendered in the main left hand navigation.

```yaml
---
hide_in_navigation: true
---
```

### "last_reviewed_on" and "review_in"

These attributes determine the date when the page needs to be reviewed next.

See [page expiry and review documentation][expiry] for more details.

You can use this in combination with the [owner_slack variable](#owner-slack) to set an owner for the page.

### layout

The layout of the page. By default, pages will use the `layout` layout. This layout will parse the page and generate a sidebar with a table of contents consisting of each `h2`, `h3`, `h4` heading.

```md
---
layout: layout
---

# The title

## A subheader

### A h3 subheader

## Another subheader
```

This layout generates a page with the headings from the content in the sidebar.

If you want more control about the layout, you can use the `core` layout. This allows you to specify the sidebar manually with a `content_for` block.

```rb
---
layout: core
---

<%% content_for :sidebar do %>
  You can put anything in the sidebar.
<%% end %>

This page has a configurable sidebar that is independent of the content.
```

If you do not specify a sidebar, you get a one-column layout without a sidebar.

```rb
---
layout: core
---

This page does not have a sidebar.
```



### old_paths

Any paths of pages that should redirect to this page.

Example:

```yaml
---
old_paths:
  - /some-old-page.html
---
```

### owner_slack

The Slack username or channel of the page owner. Use this to appoint an individual or team as responsible for keeping the page up to date.

```yaml
---
owner_slack: "#operations-teams"
---
```

### parent

Defines the page that should be highlighted as ‘active’ in the navigation.

```yaml
---
parent: shaving-yaks.html
---
```

### prevent_indexing

Set `prevent_indexing: true` to prevent the page from being indexed by search engines.

```yaml
---
prevent_indexing: true
---
```

### source_url

If the contribution banner is turned on, you can override the "View source" link using `source_url`.

Example:

```yaml
source_url: http://example.org/source.md
```

### title

The browser title of the page.

```yaml
---
title: My beautiful page
---
```
