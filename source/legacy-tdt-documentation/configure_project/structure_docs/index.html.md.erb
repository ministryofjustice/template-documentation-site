# Structure your documentation

When you [create a new project][create-project], that project has a source folder containing:

- a `documentation/index.md` content file
- an `index.html.md.erb` file

The `index.html.md.erb` file contains a `partial` that refers to the `documentation/index.md` content file.

To structure your documentation, add content directly to the `index.html.md.erb` file.

For example, an `index.html.md.erb` file with the following sections:

- an introduction
- a "Who this documentation is for" section
- a "Set up the API client" section

That `index.html.md.erb` file could look like this:

```html
---
title: Tech Docs
---

# Introduction

CONTENT

# Who is this documentation for?

CONTENT

# Set up the API client

CONTENT

```

When you build or preview your documentation site with this `index.html.md.erb`, the site will be a single page site with the following structure:

- Introduction
- Who is this documentation for?
- Set up the client

## Build a multipage documentation site

You can create a technical documentation site that splits its content across multiple pages.

This is suitable for documentation sites that have too much content for the single page format.

Examples include the:

- [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) technical documentation][paas-docs]
- [GOV.UK Pay technical documentation][pay-docs]

You should [use the search feature][search-feature] with multipage documentation sites.

### Amend the tech-docs.yml file

Add the following code to your project’s `config/tech-docs.yml` file if necessary:

```yaml
multipage_nav: true
```

### Create the multipage folder structure

Each folder inside the `source` folder represents one documentation page.

For each page, create a content folder and put an `index.html.md.erb` file into that folder. This `index.html.md.erb` file is the [content file][write-content].

### Amend the index.html.md.erb files

Add a weight argument and value to the frontmatter of each .html.md.erb file. This builds the structure of the multipage documentation.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: Product Technical Documentation
---
```

becomes

```yaml
---
title: Product Technical Documentation
weight: 10
---
```

Higher weights mean the content is lower down in the documentation hierarchy. A way to remember this is to think “heavier pages sink to the bottom”.

Make sure every individual page starts with an H1 heading.

### Nest pages within pages (optional)

You can nest pages within each other.

To do this, create content folders inside content folders with `index.html.md.erb` content files.

Each `.html.md.erb` file inside a nested folder must have a weight value that preserves the overall hierarchy both within the nested content and compared to the other non-nested content.

An example of this content structure is the GOV.UK Pay technical documentation on switching to live:

- [documentation pages][nested-example]
- [GitHub folder][nested-example-code]

<%= partial "legacy-tdt-documentation/partials/links" %>
