# Technical Documentation Template

You can use this template to create and publish technical and developer documentation ('tech docs') for users in government, including API documentation.

Using the template means that:

- your documentation will be consistent with GOV.UK's design and [other government documentation](/support/#projects-that-use-the-template)
- your technical writer can manage your documentation using the [‘docs as code’][docs-as-code-blog] approach

The template uses the [Middleman static site generator][middleman] to convert Markdown files into HTML pages. You can [publish the HTML pages anywhere that supports static sites](/publish_project/deploy/).
