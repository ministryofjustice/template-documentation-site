# Convert an OpenAPI specification into documentation

OpenAPI is an API description format for REST APIs. The government's Open Standards Board [recommends using OpenAPI][use-openapi].

You can convert an OpenAPI file into an API reference page in your documentation.

Your OpenAPI file must be both:

- [version 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md)
- in YAML format

1. Add the following to your `config/tech-docs.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    api_path: <OPENAPI_FILE>
    ```

    where `<OPENAPI_FILE>` is your OpenAPI file, for example `/openapi/openapi.yaml`.

2. Add the following in your documentation to convert the OpenAPI file into an API reference:

    ```markdown
    api>
    ```

For `api_path` you can also use:

- a relative path, for example `./openapi/openapi.yaml`
- an external file, for example `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml`

## Convert a specific endpoint

You can convert a specific endpoint using the following in your documentation: 

```markdown
api> <ENDPOINT>
```

where `<ENDPOINT>` is your endpoint, for example `/pets`.
